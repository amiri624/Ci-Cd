# Ci-Cd

### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (or Continuous Delivery). It's a set of practices and tools designed to improve the software development process by automating builds, testing, and deployment, enabling you to ship code changes faster and reliably.

- Continuous integration (CI): Automatically builds, tests, and integrates code changes within a shared repository

- Continuous delivery (CD): automatically delivers code changes to production-ready environments for approval

- Continuous deployment (CD): automatically deploys code changes to customers directly

CI/CD comprises of continuous integration and continuous delivery or continuous deployment. Put together, they form a “CI/CD pipeline”—a series of automated workflows that help DevOps teams cut down on manual tasks.
